Sure, here’s an updated version of the development prompts to Chat GPT 4o that reflects the use of a webhook trigger node from N8N instead of a Shopify trigger node.

# Development prompts to Chat GPT 4o

## Modules

### schemas

- Baseado nessas informações de documentação da API do SharpSpring e nos requisitos já discutidos, quero que você indique quais são as entidades envolvidas no processo e a relação entre elas, incluindo o código de cada uma delas.

### Workflows

#### Webhook <-> SharpSpring (marca 958):

- Based on all we discussed and this and any other saved chats on my account about N8N integrations, and the following API docs for Shopify and SharpSpring, please give a code node JavaScript snippet to get the response from a webhook trigger node that gets info about every checkout saved and then creates a lead and an opportunity linked with this lead that will be sent to SharpSpring via HTTP request nodes.

SharpSpring and Shopify API docs

response:
To achieve the integration between Shopify and SharpSpring using N8N, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up the Webhook Trigger Node**: This node will trigger the workflow when a checkout is completed and sent to the webhook.
2. **Retrieve Checkout Data**: Use the data from the webhook trigger to gather the checkout details.
3. **Create Lead in SharpSpring**: Use the retrieved checkout data to create a new lead in SharpSpring.
4. **Create Opportunity in SharpSpring**: Use the lead information to create a new opportunity linked to the lead.

Here is a JavaScript code snippet for the N8N Code node to achieve this:

```javascript
const webhookData = items[0].json;

// Extract necessary details from webhook data
const {
    email,
    shipping_address,
    billing_address,
    customer_id,
    created_at,
    total_price,
    line_items
} = webhookData.checkout || {};

// Prepare lead data for SharpSpring
const leadData = {
    method: 'createLeads',
    params: {
        objects: [
            {
                emailAddress: email,
                firstName: billing_address.first_name,
                lastName: billing_address.last_name,
                phoneNumber: billing_address.phone,
                street: billing_address.address1,
                city: billing_address.city,
                state: billing_address.province,
                zipCode: billing_address.zip,
                country: billing_address.country,
                leadSource: 'Shopify Checkout',
                customField1: customer_id,
                customField2: created_at
            }
        ]
    },
    id: 1
};

// Make an HTTP request to SharpSpring API to create lead
const leadResponse = await $http.post({
    url: `https://api.sharpspring.com/pubapi/v1/?accountID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID&secretKey=YOUR_SECRET_KEY`,
    body: leadData,
    json: true
});

const leadId = leadResponse.result.creates[0].id;

// Prepare opportunity data for SharpSpring
const opportunityData = {
    method: 'createOpportunities',
    params: {
        objects: [
            {
                leadId: leadId,
                name: `Opportunity for ${billing_address.first_name} ${billing_address.last_name}`,
                description: `Checkout created on ${created_at} with total price ${total_price}`,
                value: total_price,
                stage: 'New',
                closeDate: new Date().toISOString()
            }
        ]
    },
    id: 2
};

// Make an HTTP request to SharpSpring API to create opportunity
const opportunityResponse = await $http.post({
    url: `https://api.sharpspring.com/pubapi/v1/?accountID=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID&secretKey=YOUR_SECRET_KEY`,
    body: opportunityData,
    json: true
});

return [
    {
        json: {
            leadResponse,
            opportunityResponse
        }
    }
];
```

### Explanation:

1. **Extract Data**: Extract relevant data from the webhook data, such as email, shipping and billing addresses, customer ID, creation date, total price, and line items.
2. **Prepare Lead Data**: Create the lead data object to be sent to the SharpSpring API.
3. **Create Lead**: Send a POST request to the SharpSpring API to create a new lead.
4. **Retrieve Lead ID**: Get the newly created lead's ID from the response.
5. **Prepare Opportunity Data**: Create the opportunity data object, linking it to the created lead.
6. **Create Opportunity**: Send a POST request to the SharpSpring API to create a new opportunity linked to the lead.

### N8N Workflow Steps:

1. **Webhook Trigger Node**: Set up a webhook trigger node to get checkout data.
2. **Code Node**: Add a code node and paste the above JavaScript code.
3. **HTTP Request Node**: Ensure you have the correct HTTP request setup for SharpSpring API calls.

Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual SharpSpring account ID and secret key. Make sure to test and adjust the workflow according to your specific needs.
